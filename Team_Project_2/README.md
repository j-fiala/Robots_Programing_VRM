## Requirements:

**Software:**
```bash
Epson RC+ 7.0
```

**Programming Language:**
```bash
SPEL+
```

**Simulator StartUp:**
```bash
Restore a controler from folder VRM_Project_2
Add all the .step files into the simulator
It is essential to name the CAD files accordingly to the .main code, since the names are used within the program functions
```
## Description:

This project aimed to create a simulation in Epson Robotic Studio. The simulation presented a scene where multiple SCARA robots were palletizing 12 parts. The objective was to compare the time taken by each of the three robots to complete the task. This scenario is typically used to help potential customers determine the best robot for their application. Faster robots tend to be more expensive, so the simulation provides customers with performance data to decide whether the higher cost is justified.
