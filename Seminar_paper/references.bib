abstract="The responsibility of controlling and managing the plant growth from early stage to mature harvest stage involves monitoring and identification of plant diseases, controlled irrigation and controlled use of fertilizers and pesticides. The proposed work explores the technology of wireless sensors for remote real time monitoring of vital farm parameters like humidity, environmental temperature and moisture content of the soil. We also employ the technique of image processing for vision based automatic disease detection on plant leaves. Thus this paper vigorously describes the design and construction of an autonomous mobile robot featuring plant disease detection, growth monitoring and spraying mechanism for pesticide, fertilizer and water to apply in agriculture or plant nursery. To realize this work we provide a compact, portable and a well founded platform that can survey the farmland automatically and also can identify disease and can examine the growth of the plant and accordingly spray pesticide, fertilizer and water to the plant. This approach will help farmers make right decisions by providing real-time information about the plant and it's environment using fundamental principles of Internet, Sensor's technology and Image processing.",
